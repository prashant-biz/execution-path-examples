## Purpose
This repository contains documentation examples of execution paths and decision boundaries used for review-readiness in enterprise workflow governance.

## What this documents
- Invoice exception handling execution path (missing PO, duplicate-invoice detection).
- Deterministic invoice processing workflow (inbound invoice → ERP-safe draft) with explicit authority boundaries and audit artifacts.
- Decision boundary slice showing where AI classification stops and deterministic control begins.

## What this does NOT do
- This repository does not define policy or certify compliance.
- This repository does not represent compliance certification.
- This repository does not assign implementation responsibility to any party.

## Why this matters for review
Enterprise reviews stall when stakeholders cannot trace what a system is allowed to do and where decision authority resides.
Decision boundaries, ownership, escalation paths, and audit evidence requirements are documented as explicit workflow surfaces.

## Status
Prepared as documentation examples converted into Markdown from provided source documents.
