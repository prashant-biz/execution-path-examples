## Purpose
This folder documents an invoice exception handling execution path with an explicit decision boundary and review surfaces for exception ownership and audit evidence.

## What this documents
- Exception handling scope: missing Purchase Order (PO) and duplicate-invoice detection.
- Deterministic execution path stages, with owner attribution and evidence logged.
- Logged separation between AI recommendations and human authorization decisions.

## What this does NOT do
- This documentation does not represent compliance certification.
- Authority remains defined by organizational policy and governance processes.
- Logs support transparency and do not replace governance review.

## Why this matters for review
Invoices stall when exception ownership is unclear and decisions cannot be reconstructed from recorded evidence.
Decision boundaries and exception routing are documented so reviewers can evaluate actions without assumptions.

## Status
Converted into Markdown from “Review-Ready Execution Path • Invoice Exception Handling • Version 2.0”.
